# Tetris
Older tetris minigame creates using tkinter canvas and ony functions.
Controls:
- a,d - moving to sides
- k,l - rotating counter-clokwise and clockwise
- f,h - fast and instant drop (locked)

Has a New Game button that resets the game.  
It has quite a few bugs, pieces can clip into each other if rotated too fast and some other bugs are present.
